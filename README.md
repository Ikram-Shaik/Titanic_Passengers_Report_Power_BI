# Titanic_Passengers_Report_Power_BI

**Titanic Report** is an interactive Power BI project that analyzes the Titanic dataset to reveal insights about passenger demographics, fare distribution, and more. This report leverages visualizations, drill-throughs, and synced filters to enable dynamic data exploration.

## Project Overview

This Power BI report provides an in-depth look at Titanic passenger data. The report is split across multiple pages, each focusing on different insights and features:

- **Donut Chart**: Displays the total fare by class.
- **Table Chart with Drill-through**: Shows class-wise data, including deck, fare, embark town, and total age, with a drill-through feature for class details.
- **Custom Visual (Enlighten Aquarium)**: Visualizes passenger first names by age.
- **Bookmark**: Highlights fare by first name and average age by deck for Queenstown, accessible via an information button.
- **Q&A Bar Chart**: Displays total 'pclass' by class.
- **Decomposition Tree**: Breaks down fare by deck, sex, and first name.
- **Sync Slicer**: Allows the 'embark town' filter to apply across all relevant pages.

## Features

- **Interactive Exploration**: Use drill-throughs and synced slicers to navigate across pages and explore data in detail.
- **Dynamic Visuals**: Custom visuals and decomposition trees offer unique ways to understand relationships within the data.
- **Q&A Integration**: Ask questions directly to reveal data insights in real-time.
